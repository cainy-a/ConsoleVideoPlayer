# ConsoleVideoPlayer
The video player for your terminal.

This project requires a 24bit colour terminal such as kitty.

This is a tool to play a video on your terminal!
It can theoretically render at any resolution,
and at any framerate.

In practice however, it is limited by the speed the terminal
is capable of rendering at.
For example kitty on my laptop fails to render
at 60fps at the default resolution.
I suggest around 30fps for best results.
